# Personalized Movie Recommender System

A Jupyter Notebook-based project that provides personalized movie recommendations using machine learning algorithms. The system suggests movies tailored to individual user preferences based on their ratings, watch history, and other features.

## Features

- Personalized movie recommendations
- Search for movies by title, genre, or keywords
- User rating and feedback system (within the notebook)
- Easy to modify and experiment with recommendation algorithms

## Technologies Used

- **Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn (optional)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PersonalizedMovieRecoommenderSystem.git
   cd PersonalizedMovieRecoommenderSystem
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then open the main `.ipynb` file in your browser.

4. **Run the notebook cells:**
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to load data, train the model, and get recommendations.

## Usage

- Edit the notebook cells to input your own ratings or preferences.
- Run the recommendation cells to see personalized movie suggestions.
- Modify the algorithms or data as needed for experimentation.

## Customization

- Update the recommendation logic in the notebook to try different algorithms.
- Use your own movie datasets by updating the data loading cells.
